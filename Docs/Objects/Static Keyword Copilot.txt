In AutoHotkey v2, the static keyword in a class is used to define class-level variables or methods — meaning they belong to the class itself, not to any instance of the class. Here's why and when you'd use static in a class:

🔧 Why Use static in a Class
1. Shared State Across All Instances
- A static property or method is shared across all instances of the class.
- Useful for things like counters, caches, or configuration values.
class Counter {
    static count := 0

    __New() {
        Counter.count++
    }
}


Every time you create a new Counter object, Counter.count increases — shared across all instances.

2. Utility Methods That Don’t Need an Instance
- static methods can be called without creating an object.
- Great for helper functions or factory methods.
class MathUtils {
    static Square(x) {
        return x * x
    }
}

MsgBox MathUtils.Square(5)  ; Outputs 25



3. Persistent Data Within a Method
- Inside a method, static variables retain their value between calls.
class Logger {
    static Log(msg) {
        static logCount := 0
        logCount++
        MsgBox "Log #" logCount ": " msg
    }
}



🧠 Summary
|  | static |

If you're building reusable tools or managing state across multiple scripts or hotkeys, static can help you keep things clean and efficient. Want to see how it behaves in a real-world AHK v2 script you're working on?
