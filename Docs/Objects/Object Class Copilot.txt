In AutoHotkey v2, the Object class provides the foundational properties and methods for all objects. These include general-purpose tools for key-value access, iteration, cloning, and meta-functionality.
Here’s a breakdown of the most important built-in methods and properties of the Object class in AHK v2:

🔧 Core Methods of the Object Class
|  |  | 
| Obj.Clone() |  | 
| Obj.Count() |  | 
| Obj.Delete(Key) |  | 
| Obj.Has(Key) | true | 
| Obj.Get(Key, Default?) |  | 
| Obj.Set(Key, Value) |  | 
| Obj.InsertAt(Index, Value...) |  | 
| Obj.RemoveAt(Index, Length?) |  | 
| Obj.Push(Value...) |  | 
| Obj.Pop() |  | 
| Obj.MinIndex()Obj.MaxIndex() |  | 
| Obj.Length |  | 



🧠 Meta-Functionality and Inheritance
- Prototype-based inheritance: Every object can have a base object (Obj.Prototype) from which it inherits properties and methods.
- Custom behavior: You can override methods like __Get, __Set, __Call, __New, and __Delete to customize object behavior.

🧪 Iteration Support
Objects support for-loops using:
for key, value in obj


This iterates over all key-value pairs.

📚 Additional Notes
- All classes in AHK v2 ultimately derive from the Object class.
- Arrays are just objects with numeric keys and extra methods like Push, Pop, etc.
- You can define your own classes using class MyClass { ... }, and they inherit from Object unless otherwise specified.
For the full official reference, check out the AutoHotkey v2 Object class documentation.
