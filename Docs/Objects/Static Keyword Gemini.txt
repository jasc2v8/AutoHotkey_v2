You use the static keyword in an AutoHotkey v2 class for methods and properties that belong to the class itself, rather than a specific instance of the class.

💡 Key Differences
The core distinction is in ownership and behavior:

Static Members (Class Members):

Ownership: They belong to the class object, not to individual objects created from the class (instances).

Access: You access them directly using the class name (e.g., MyClass.StaticProperty).

Sharing: A single copy of a static property is shared across all instances of the class and the class itself.

Methods: Static methods cannot access instance properties or other non-static methods because they are called without a specific instance. They are used for utility functions related to the class concept.

Non-Static Members (Instance Members):

Ownership: They belong to the Prototype object of the class, meaning they are available to, and often specific to, each individual instance created from the class.

Access: You access them through an instance of the class (e.g., myInstance.InstanceProperty).

Sharing: Each instance has its own separate copy (for properties) or refers to the same method definition (for methods), but the data they operate on (this) is unique to the instance.

🎯 Use Cases for Static
You would use static for:

Constants and Shared Configuration: Storing values that should be the same for all instances of the class and accessible without creating an object.

AutoHotkey

class MyClass {
    static MAX_COUNT := 100  ; A constant shared by all
}
MsgBox MyClass.MAX_COUNT ; Access directly via the class name
Factory Methods: Methods that create and return new instances of the class, or a related class, which don't need an existing instance to be called.

AutoHotkey

class Coord {
    static FromString(s) {
        ; Logic to parse a string like "10,20" and return a new Coord object
    }
}
Utility Functions (Class-Related Helpers): Functions that logically relate to the class but don't operate on the unique data of a specific instance. For example, a method to validate input before creating an instance.

AutoHotkey

class Validator {
    static IsValidEmail(email) {
        ; return true or false based on validation
    }
}
Static members provide a way to group related functions and data under a class's namespace without requiring object instantiation, keeping your code organized and preventing namespace pollution.
