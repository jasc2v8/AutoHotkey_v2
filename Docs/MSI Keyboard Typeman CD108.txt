The typical Scan Code Set 2 key code for the Calculator key (often labeled "Cal" or a calculator icon) on PC keyboards is:

E0 21
This is the "make code" sent when the key is pressed. The "break code" (when the key is released) is typically:

E0 A1
The MSI Typeman CK108, like most keyboards with dedicated media or application keys, likely uses this standard code for the Calculator function.



The MSI Typeman CK108 keyboard likely uses the standard PC key codes for the Escape key, which can vary depending on the context (e.g., ASCII, Windows Virtual-Key, or Scan Code).

Here are the most common standard key codes for the Escape key:

ASCII Code (Decimal): 27

Windows Virtual-Key Code (Hexadecimal): 0x1B (Constant is VK_ESCAPE)

Scan Code Set 1 (Hexadecimal): 01 (Make code) or 81 (Break code)

If you are trying to program or remap a key on the MSI Typeman CK108, the Scan Code (usually 01) is often what is needed for low-level keyboard utilities, or the Virtual-Key Code (often 0x1B) for Windows-based software.
