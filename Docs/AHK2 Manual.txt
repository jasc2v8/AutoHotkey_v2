GUID
	/**
	 *  Setting a GUID in Inno Setup is crucial for ensuring a 
	 * consistent and unique identity for your application across
	 * different versions. The GUID (Globally Unique Identifier)
	 * is used by the Windows operating system to track your application for
	 * uninstallation and updates.
	 * 
	 *  In Inno Setup, the GUID is defined using the AppId directive
	 * in the [Setup] section of your script. You should always set a 
	 * unique GUID for your application and keep it consistent for all
	 * future installer versions. This prevents the installer from 
	 * creating multiple uninstall entries and ensures updates work correctly.
	 * 
	 *  ;@Inno-AppId is a custom directive that is ignored by
	 * the Ahk2exe compiler. This application reads this value and writes it to
	 * the ISS Template you select.
