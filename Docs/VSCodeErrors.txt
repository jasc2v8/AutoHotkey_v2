Copilot prompt:

AHK++ VSCode Extension
Request textDocument/signatureHelp fails
  Message: Request textDocument/signatureHelp failed with message: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'document')
  Code: -32603 

What to do until the bug is patched:
Reload VSCode Window: Use Ctrl+Shift+P → Reload Window.
This forces the extension to reinitialize the document context.
