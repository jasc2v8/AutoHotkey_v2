AutoHotkey v2 supports several meta-functions that allow you to customize class behavior, including object construction, property access, method calls, and enumeration. These are defined as special methods inside your class and are automatically invoked by the interpreter.

 Meta-Functions in AHK v2 Classes
Here’s a complete list of built-in meta-functions you can define in your classes:
 Construction & Destruction
 __New() – Called when a new instance is created.
 __Delete() – Called when an object is being released (rarely needed).
 Property Access
 __Get(key, params*) – Called when accessing a property that doesn't exist.
 __Set(key, value, params*) – Called when assigning to a property that doesn't exist.
 __Call(methodName, args*) – Called when invoking a method that doesn't exist.
 Enumeration
- __Enum(n) – Enables custom iteration with for loops. n is the enumeration mode (1 for key-value, 2 for values only).
 Cloning
- Clone() – You can define this to support deep or shallow copying of your object.

Example: Custom Property Access
class MyClass {
    __New(name) {
        this.name := name
    }

    __Get(key) {
        MsgBox "Attempted to get: " key
        return "default"
    }

    __Set(key, value) {
        MsgBox "Attempted to set: " key " to " value
    }

    __Call(method, args*) {
        MsgBox "Unknown method: " method
    }
}

obj := MyClass("Jim")
value := obj.undefinedProp        ; triggers __Get
obj.newProp := "Hello"            ; triggers __Set
obj.unknownMethod(1, 2)           ; triggers __Call

Would you like a template for a class that uses all these meta-functions for debugging or logging?
