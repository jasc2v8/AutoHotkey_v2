ObjTree - Objects, Arrays, Maps, Strings, String CSV, String List (`n separators)
ObjGui - Gui Objects Hwnd, Title, currently focused control, and a full list of Controls, showing their Type (Button, Edit, etc.), Name, Hwnd, current Text/Value, and Visibility status.

As of version v2.0.56, the script has evolved from a simple object viewer into a versatile inspector. It identifies the type of data you pass to it and adapts the TreeView structure accordingly.

Here are all the containers and data formats currently supported:

1. AutoHotkey Objects
	Objects: Standard AHK objects. It iterates through all OwnProps() (properties).
	Arrays: Indexed lists. It displays the index and the associated value or nested object.
	Maps: Key-value pairs. It supports any data type as a key and sorts them logically.

	Circular References: The script tracks "Visited" objects to prevent infinite loops, labeling them [Circular Reference].

2. Specialized AHK Types
	Gui Objects: When you pass a Gui object (e.g., myGui := Gui()), the script lists:
	Window Hwnd and Title.
	Currently focused control.
	A full list of Controls, showing their Type (Button, Edit, etc.), Name, Hwnd, current Text/Value, and Visibility status.

3. String-Based Containers
	The script "sniffs" raw strings to see if they follow common data patterns:
	Newline Lists (n): If a string contains line breaks, it creates a [List] node where each line is a separate child entry.
	CSV Rows (,): If a string contains commas (and no newlines), it creates a [CSV Row] node, splitting the string into columns and trimming whitespace.
	Raw Values: If the string doesn't match the patterns above, it is simply displayed as a single value node.
