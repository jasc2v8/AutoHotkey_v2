FileCreateShortcut

no icon if ahk

icon if compiled in exe

__New(TrayTipTimeout:=1500, IconFile:="", IconNumber:=0)


FileCreateShortcut: dll, exe, or icon


"C:\Users\Jim\Documents\AutoHotkey\Lib\Icons\under-construction.ico"


I didn't word it properly, but my focus is on running .ahk files, not .exe files compiled with an icon.
I get too many false A/V positives with .exe files so I run .ahk files.
No gui is needed for the tray icon, but is used for the task bar icon running an .ahk script.
Great info about FileCreateShortcut, thanks!
I suppose I could change to
