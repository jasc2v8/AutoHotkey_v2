Limitations to Consider
Dynamic Calls: Functions called via SetTimer, Hotkey, or %VarName%() are difficult to detect via static analysis. You may need to manually include those.

Classes: Merging individual methods from a class is risky; usually, it is safer to include the entire class if any part of it is used.

Nested Braces: The parser must count { and } to ensure it captures the entire function body correctly.
