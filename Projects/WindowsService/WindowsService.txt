✅ Advantages of NSSM:
- Handles logging and restart on crash.
- Easier to configure than raw sc.exe.
- Gracefully manages lifecycle for executables that aren’t true services.

⚡ Which to choose?
- Quick and dirty: sc.exe if you just need the script to run at boot and don’t care about graceful stop.
- Robust and maintainable: NSSM if you want logging, restart, and clean lifecycle management.
