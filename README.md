# Include
Many scripts have #Include <file>, therefore you must have the Lib files in one of the Script Library Folders:
  A_ScriptDir "\Lib\"                                      ; Local library.
	A_MyDocuments "\AutoHotkey\Lib\"                          ; User library.
	"directory-of-the-currently-running-AutoHotkey.exe\Lib\"  ; Standard library.
