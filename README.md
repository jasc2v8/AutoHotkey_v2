# #Include \<Lib\>
Many scripts have #Include statements, therefore you must have the Lib files in one of the Script Library Folders:

1. A_ScriptDir "\Lib\"                                      ; Local library.
  
2. A_MyDocuments "\AutoHotkey\Lib\"                          ; User library.
  
3. "directory-of-the-currently-running-AutoHotkey.exe\Lib\"  ; Standard library.
